"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained. His comments come in the wake of a JoyNews Hotline investigation led by GH Probe’s Francisca Enchil, which uncovered disturbing levels of collusion at examination centres.",news,"[Mmoa a wɔn a wɔamfa wɔn ho nsɛm mu, wɔn a wɔn nni ho nsɛm mu.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ɛwɔm sɛ nhwɛsoɔ ahorow a ɛfa abɔdeɛ ne amammerɛ ho wɔ hɔ a wɔde di dwuma sɛ ɔkɔm a ɛde wɔn a wɔpɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho bɛhyɛ MHCS mu.

"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Ansa na ɔyɛ adwuma no, Unoka yɛ nnwontofoɔ pa.

"For rural communities in Ghana, especially in the Kumbungu district, access to and use of maternal healthcare services (MHCS) remain a significant challenge. This study set out to explore the specific barriers preventing women from utilizing these services and to evaluate the quality of care provided. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to get a comprehensive view of the situation.

"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem.

"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo yɛ obi a ɔwɔ nipa a ɛyɛ den, ana wɔn a ɛyɛ kɛseɛ na ɔwɔ nsaman a ɛyɛ kɛseɛ, a ɛfiri n'ani a ɛyɛ kɛseɛ ne n'ani a ɛyɛ kɛseɛ.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Nnwuma no kyerɛe sɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ mmaa no mu dɔɔso nyinara de ne ho hyɛɛ nsaman ahorow a ɛfa nsaman ahorow a ɛfa mmɔfra a wɔde ma wɔn—87.5% yɛɛ antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% wɔɔ mmɔfra wɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ pɛ mu, na 84.8% wɔɔ postnatal care (PNC) visit—nsaman no hyia no na ɛyɛ nsɛm.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Kumbungu mantam mu no, nneɛma ahorow a wɔn a wɔde bɛma nhomasuafo ne nneɛma a wɔde ma wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ nhomasua no, wɔde nneɛma a wɔn a wɔde bɛma wɔn ho hyɛɛ nhomasua no.
