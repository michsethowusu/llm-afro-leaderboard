"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Kɔnɔninw bɛɛ kɛcɛya la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la, kɛlɛbɔ la,","The kingdom of heaven is like a man who has a sheep, and the sheep have a goat, and the goats have a shepherd, and the goats have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the goats have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the goats have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the goats have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the goats have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd, and the sheep have a shepherd.",-0.03226706385612488
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Unoka bɛɛ bɛɛn bɛɛn, o bɛɛ yɛrɛw tɛmɛnɛ.

"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem. For example, health service providers specifically recommended a greater number of trained midwives and the provision of critical logistics like ultrasound machines and proper delivery equipment to ensure effective and high-quality care.",academic,"[Sɛbɛnni ina fɔlɔra ka bɛɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ kɛlɛbɔ la, a bɛ sɔrɔ","For the first time in history, all people have the same experience in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in warfare, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in war, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at,",0.14055007696151733
"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[ɛn bɛɛ bɛɛ, 87.5% kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra ANC, 87.3% kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra PNC, 84.8% kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka kɛɛra a kɛnɛkɛw ka","[all, 87.5% of the students were ANC, 87.3% were PNC, 84.8% were PNC students, and the remaining students were the only students who were eligible to receive a scholarship to attend the University of Southern California's School of Social Work.",0.17022106051445007

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Kumbungu duguw ka fɛnba sigi la, kɛrɛnɛkɛw ni sɛrɛfɛw bɛɛ ka kɛnɛkɛw fɛnba sigi la.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life. Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, Okonkwo tɛmɛn, o taa sigi wɛrɛ ɲɛfɛnna kɔnɔ.
