"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Agbọnmẹ gbẹtọ tọn yin didi taidi ayinamẹnu he to yiyi to whẹho mẹlọnọ tọn po mẹlọnọ tọn po.

"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem. For example, health service providers specifically recommended a greater number of trained midwives and the provision of critical logistics like ultrasound machines and proper delivery equipment to ensure effective and high-quality care.",academic,"[Ètò ylọ wẹnsan sọn hlanmẹ tọn wẹ dọ, mẹlẹpo wẹ tin to azọ́nwa mẹ, bo ka sọ yin azọ́nwatọ he yin zinzin, bo ka sọ yin azọ́nwatọ he yin zinzin, bo ka

"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo yɔn nɔvi wɛ, kɛkɛ wɛ, wɛ ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ, ɖo nɔvi wɛ,","[Brother] brother, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly, brotherly,",0.1593412160873413

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,[Ègbè ètọn wẹ yí sọn ègbè ètọn he wá sọn ègbè ètọn he wá sọn ègbè ètọn he wá sọn ègbè ètọn he wá sọn ègbè ètọn he wá sọn ègbè ètọn he wá sọn
