"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[An bayyana wasu abubuwa masu alaka da tattalin arzikin da al'ada a matsayin babban kawar da shiga da amfani da MHCS.

These data suggest that maternal health care in that region is more than just improving clinical practices; it also means fighting the stigma of the group and the group that the women's movement faces every day.]"
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[In koshin sa, Unoka ya kasance mawakin da ishara.

"For rural communities in Ghana, especially in the Kumbungu district, access to and use of maternal healthcare services (MHCS) remain a significant challenge. This study set out to explore the specific barriers preventing women from utilizing these services and to evaluate the quality of care provided. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to get a comprehensive view of the situation. This phased design involved surveying 441 pregnant and postpartum women and conducting interviews with 20 healthcare providers.

"Okonkwo was a man of great renown throughout his nine villages and even beyond, a fame built entirely on his own remarkable achievements. At just eighteen years old, he brought honor to his village by defeating Amalinze the Cat, a legendary wrestler who had been undefeated for seven years.

"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem. For example, health service providers specifically recommended a greater number of trained midwives and the provision of critical logistics like ultrasound machines and proper delivery equipment to ensure effective and high-quality care.",academic,"[Karatu ta kuma haskaka kan matsalolin muhimmin da ke tattare da ingancin kulawa a wuraren aiki.

"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo shi ne mutum mai kawo tsoro, dogo da kiba tare da

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester.
