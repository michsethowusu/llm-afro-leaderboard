"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ukoo wa mambo ya kiuchumi na kitamaduni uligunduliwa kuwa vikwazo vikuu vya kupata na kutumia huduma za afya ya akili.

Zaidi ya hayo, zaidi ya theluthi moja ya wanawake walitaja mazoea ya kitamaduni ndani ya jamii zao kuwa sababu ya kuchelewa kutafuta huduma. Matokeo haya yanaonyesha kwamba kushughulikia afya ya uzazi katika eneo hili kunahitaji zaidi ya kuboresha huduma za kimatibabu pekee; pia inamaanisha kushughulikia changamoto za kijamii na za kibinafsi ambazo wanawake hukabiliana nazo kila siku.]","[Economic and cultural factors were found to be the main barriers to accessing and using mental health services.

These results suggest that addressing reproductive health in this area requires more than just improving medical services; it also means addressing the social and personal challenges that women face every day.]"
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace.

"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem.
