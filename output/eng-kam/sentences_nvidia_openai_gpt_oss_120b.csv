"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained. His comments come in the wake of a JoyNews Hotline investigation led by GH Probe’s Francisca Enchil, which uncovered disturbing levels of collusion at examination centres.",news,"[Ni watu ambao hakuna shaka hawajathibitisha kuwa wana thamani ya imani ambayo tumeiweka kwao. Kuhusu kazi hii, niruhusu pia kusema kuwa wakati wa BECE, maamuzi mengi huchukuliwa na Huduma ya Elimu ya Ghana. Kwa mfano, uteuzi wa wasimamizi na waangalizi hufanywa na afisa wa mitihani wa wilaya, alieleza. Maoni yake yametoka katikati ya uchunguzi wa Hotline ya JoyNews ulioongozwa na Francisca Enchil wa GH Probe, ambao ulifichua viwango vya kusumbua vya ushirikiano katika vituo vya mtihani.]"
"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ukoo wa mambo ya kiuchumi na kitamaduni uligunduliwa kuwa vikwazo vikuu vya kupata na kutumia huduma za afya ya akili. Zaidi ya nusu ya wanawake waliojibu majaribio walitaja umaskini, ujuzi usio wa kutosha, vikwazo kutoka kwa waume zao, umbali wa vituo vya afya, na mizunguko ndefu kuwa sababu za kutotumia huduma. Zaidi ya hayo, zaidi ya theluthi moja ya wanawake walitaja mazoea ya kitamaduni ndani ya jamii zao kuwa sababu ya kuchelewa kutafuta huduma. Matokeo haya yanaonyesha kwamba kushughulikia afya ya uzazi katika eneo hili kunahitaji zaidi ya kuboresha huduma za kimatibabu pekee; pia inamaanisha kushughulikia changamoto za kijamii na za kibinafsi ambazo wanawake hukabiliana nazo kila siku.]"
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Ingawa alikuwa na kasoro, Unoka alikuwa mwanamuziki wenye kipaji. Alikuwa mtu mrefu lakini mnyembamba sana na mguu ulioegemea na uso wa kusikitisha, ambao ungepotea anapokunywa pombe au kucheza filimbi yake. Muda wake wa furaha zaidi ulikuwa miezi baada ya mavuno, wakati wanamuziki wa kijiji wangechukua ala zao za muziki kutoka juu ya jiko. Unoka alijiunga nao, uso wake ukijaa furaha na amani. Mara nyingine, vijiji vingine vilimwita Unoka na bendi yake kufundisha nyimbo zao, na walikaa kwa miezi kadhaa, kushiriki muziki wao.]"
"At the Derby Avenue RC Basic School and St. George’s Anglican Basic School in Accra, invigilators were captured openly demanding GH¢60 daily tokens, supervisors pocketed envelopes of GH¢400, and candidates were asked to contribute to an Aseda Offertory. John Kapi stressed that once WAEC provides feedback on such incidents, it is the responsibility of the Ghana Education Service (GES) to take decisive action. And so when these issues come up, once the feedback goes to them, we [WAEC] expect that they would react appropriately and ensure that the right action is taken against the people, he said.",news,"[Katika shule za msingi za Derby Avenue RC na St. George’s Anglican huko Accra, waangalizi waliwekwa waziwazi wakidai tokeni za kila siku za GH¢60, waangalizi walipakua envelopu za GH¢400, na wanafunzi walitakiwa kuchangia Aseda Offertory. John Kapi alisisitiza kwamba mara WAEC inatoa maoni kuhusu matukio kama hayo, ni wajibu wa Huduma ya Elimu ya Ghana (GES) kuchukua hatua za haraka. Na kwa hivyo wakati masuala haya yanapotokea, mara maoni yanapowasilishwa kwao, tuna [WAEC] matarajio kwamba watajibu ipasavyo na kuhakikisha kwamba hatua sahihi inachukuliwa dhidi ya watu hao, alisema.]"
"For rural communities in Ghana, especially in the Kumbungu district, access to and use of maternal healthcare services (MHCS) remain a significant challenge. This study set out to explore the specific barriers preventing women from utilizing these services and to evaluate the quality of care provided. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to get a comprehensive view of the situation. This phased design involved surveying 441 pregnant and postpartum women and conducting interviews with 20 healthcare providers. A facility checklist was also used to assess the state of clinics, including the availability of essential drugs and equipment.",academic,"[Kwa jamii za vijijini nchini Ghana, hasa katika wilaya ya Kumbungu, upatikanaji na matumizi ya huduma za afya ya uzazi (MHCS) bado ni changamoto kubwa. Utafiti huu ulianzisha kuchunguza vikwazo maalum vinavyowazuia wanawake kutumia huduma hizi na kutathmini ubora wa huduma zinazotolewa. Utafiti huu ulitumia mbinu ya mchanganyiko, ikichanganya data ya kiasi na ubora ili kupata mtazamo kamili wa hali hiyo. Muundo huu uliofanywa kwa muda ulihusisha kufanya utafiti kwa wanawake wajawazito na baada ya kujifungua 441 na kufanya mahojiano na watoa huduma za afya 20. Orodha ya kituo pia ilitumika kutathmini hali ya klinik, ikiwa ni pamoja na upatikanaji wa dawa muhimu na vifaa.]"
"Okonkwo was a man of great renown throughout his nine villages and even beyond, a fame built entirely on his own remarkable achievements. At just eighteen years old, he brought honor to his village by defeating Amalinze the Cat, a legendary wrestler who had been undefeated for seven years. Amalinze earned his nickname because his back never once touched the earth. The old men of the village considered Okonkwo's victory one of the fiercest fights they had ever seen.",literature,"[Okonkwo alikuwa mtu mashuhuri sana katika vijiji vyake tisa na hata zaidi, umaarufu uliojengwa kabisa kwa mafanikio yake ya kipekee. Akiwa na umri wa miaka kumi na nane tu, alileta heshima kwenye kijiji chake kwa kumshinda Amalinze Mnyama, mpiganaji maarufu ambaye hakuwa ameshindwa kwa miaka saba. Amalinze alipata jina lake la utani kwa sababu mgongo wake haukutikisa dunia hata mara moja. Wazee wa kijiji walihesabu ushindi wa Okonkwo kuwa moja ya mapigano makali zaidi waliyowahi kuona.]"
"Muntaka assured the committee of full logistical and secretariat support from the Ministry and urged them to partner with civil society organizations, development partners, and faith-based institutions in carrying out their work. He described the task as heavy but honorable, stressing that the people of Gbenyiri and surrounding communities were looking up to the committee as instruments of peace, reconciliation, and healing.",news,"[Muntaka alimhakikishia kamati ya usaidizi kamili wa kimkakati na usaidizi wa sekretariati kutoka Wizara na kuwaomba kushirikiana na mashirika ya kiraia, washirika wa maendeleo, na taasisi za kidini katika kufanya kazi yao. Aliielezea kazi hiyo kama nzuri lakini ya heshima, akisisitiza kwamba watu wa Gbenyiri na jamii zinazozunguka walikuwa wakimtazamia kamati kama zana za amani, upatanisho, na uponyaji.]"
"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem. For example, health service providers specifically recommended a greater number of trained midwives and the provision of critical logistics like ultrasound machines and proper delivery equipment to ensure effective and high-quality care.",academic,"[Nyundo hii pia ilionyesha changamoto kubwa za kitengo ambazo zinaharibu ubora wa huduma. Jambo kuu lilikuwa idadi isiyo ya kutosha ya akiba, ambayo inaweza kuchangia mizunguko ndefu ya wanawake walizoripoti. Zaidi ya hayo, ukosefu wa vifaa muhimu na dawa ulikuwa tatizo kubwa. Kwa mfano, watoa huduma za afya hasa walipendekeza kuwa na idadi kubwa ya akiba waliofunzwa na upatikanaji wa mbinu muhimu kama vile mashine za kusikia sauti na vifaa vya kutosha vya kujifungua ili kuhakikisha huduma bora na ya ubora.]"
"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo alikuwa mtu mwenye nguvu, mrefu na mwenye uzito mkubwa wenye uso mkali, matokeo ya mabega yake ya kawaida na pua pana. Kupumua kwake kulikuwa kwa uzito sana kwamba familia yake ilikuwa inaweza kusikia kutoka kwa nyumba zao wakati alipokuwa amelala. Wakati alipokuwa akitembea, viatu vyake havikuwa vikigusa ardhini, na kuifanya iweonekana kama anayekusanyika kumpiga mtu—jambo ambalo mara nyingi alilifanya. Alikuwa na kikohozi kidogo, na katika nyakati za hasira, alikuwa akitegemea mikono yake wakati maneno yalishindwa kumwambia. Hakukuwa na subira kwa wanaume ambao hawakuwa wenye mafanikio, na hisia hii ilikuwa na sababu ya aibu yake ya kina kwa ajili ya baba yake.]"

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Kamba translation: Utafiti uligundua kuwa ingawa asilimia kubwa ya wanawake walihusika na huduma fulani za afya ya uzazi—87.5% walihudhuria huduma ya kabla ya kujifungua (ANC), 87.3% walipata kujifungua kwa mtaalamu, na 84.8% walipata ziara ya baada ya kujifungua (PNC) — marudio ya huduma ilikuwa wasiwasi. Kidogo zaidi ya nusu ya washiriki (53.4%) walikuwa na ziara zinazopendekezwa nne au zaidi za ANC, na karibu nusu (46.9%) hawakujisajili mpaka katika roboduara yao ya pili.

"The crowd held its breath as the drums beat and the flutes sang. Amalinze was a clever opponent, but Okonkwo was just as skilled, and as slippery as a fish in water. Both men were incredibly strong, their muscles and nerves straining to the point of almost breaking. But in the end, Okonkwo emerged victorious. This monumental win was just the beginning of his legacy. Over the next twenty years, his fame spread like a wildfire, fueled by his unwavering resolve and personal triumphs.",literature,"[Jamii ilikaa kimya kwa kuwa ngoma zilipiga na filimbi zilikata.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Kuimarisha afya ya uzazi katika wilaya ya Kumbungu, washiriki wa utafiti na watoa huduma walitoa mapendekezo yanayoweza kutekelezwa.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration.
