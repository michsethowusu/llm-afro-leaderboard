"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained. His comments come in the wake of a JoyNews Hotline investigation led by GH Probe’s Francisca Enchil, which uncovered disturbing levels of collusion at examination centres.",news,[Tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm,"[T]he case of the plaintiff in the action is the case of the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the plaintiff in the action, the defendant in the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, the action, and the action, and the claimed, and the claim against, and the claim against, and the claim against",0.09906339645385742
"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,[Kabiyè translation: Tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm tɔm t,"[Translation: The word is derived from the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their"" and the Greek word for ""their""].",0.0534820593893528
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Kɛɖɛŋa naŋa tɩŋa Unoka, ɛlɛ ɛɛkɛ ɖɩɣa tɔɔna.

"For rural communities in Ghana, especially in the Kumbungu district, access to and use of maternal healthcare services (MHCS) remain a significant challenge. This study set out to explore the specific barriers preventing women from utilizing these services and to evaluate the quality of care provided.

His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept.

A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester.

Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life. Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, tata wa Okonkwo, amekufa miaka kumi iliyopita. Alikuwa mtu anayejulikana kwa uvivu wake na usio na uangalifu, akiishi tu kwa sasa bila kuzingatia siku zijazo.

Alikuwa na imani kwamba kuona mdomo wa mgonjwa ni kuona ujinga wa kutokula kilicho nacho maishani. Unoka pia alikuwa na deni kubwa, akidaiwa na watu wengi wa majirani zake.]","[Unoka, father of Okonkwo, who died ten years ago.
