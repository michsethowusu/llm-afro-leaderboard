"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained. His comments come in the wake of a JoyNews Hotline investigation led by GH Probe’s Francisca Enchil, which uncovered disturbing levels of collusion at examination centres.",news,"[Ni watu ambao hakuna ushahidi wazi kwamba wameonyesha kuwa wana thamani ya imani ambayo tumewapa. Kuhusu kazi hii, ninaomba pia nionyeshe kuwa wakati wa BECE, maamuzi mengi huchukuliwa na Huduma ya Elimu ya Ghana. Kwa mfano, uteuzi wa wasimamizi na wafanyakazi wa mtihani hufanywa na afisa wa mtihani wa wilaya, alieleza. Maoni yake yametolewa katika kipindi cha uchunguzi wa JoyNews Hotline ulioongozwa na Francisca Enchil wa GH Probe, ambao uligundua viwango vya kusikitisha vya ushirikiano katika vituo vya mtihani.]","[These are people who have not been proven to be worthy of the trust we have placed in them.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ndai ya mambo ya kiuchumi na kitamaduni yalitambuliwa kama vizuizi vikuu vya kupata na kutumia MHCS. Zaidi ya nusu ya wanawake waliohojiwa walitaja umaskini, ujuzi usio na elimu, vikwazo kutoka kwa waume wao, umbali wa vituo vya afya, na mizunguko ndefu kama sababu za kutotumia huduma. Zaidi ya hayo, zaidi ya theluthi moja ya wanawake walitaja mazoea ya kitamaduni ndani ya jamii zao kama sababu ya kupunguza kutafuta huduma. Matokeo haya yanaonyesha kwamba kushughulikia afya ya uzazi katika eneo hili linahitaji zaidi ya kuboresha tu huduma za kimatibabu; pia ina maana ya kushughulikia changamoto za kijamii na za kibinafsi zilizo na mizizi ya kina ambazo wanawake hukabiliana nazo kila siku.]","[Economic and cultural factors were identified as the main barriers to accessing and using MHCS. More than half of the women surveyed cited poverty, lack of education, obstacles from their husbands, distance from health centers, and long cycles as reasons for not using the service. Additionally, more than one-third of women cited cultural practices within their communities as reasons for reduced access to services. These results suggest that addressing reproductive health in this area requires more than just improving medical services; it also requires addressing the social and personal challenges that are at the root of many of the challenges women face every day.]"
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Ndĩrĩ ya kũrĩa kwake, Unoka aarĩ mũthĩnĩ wa mũgĩthĩ.

"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Kuiga mbere afya ya wanawake katika eneo la Kumbungu, wachunguzi na watoa huduma walitoa mapendekezo yanayoweza kutekelezwa.
