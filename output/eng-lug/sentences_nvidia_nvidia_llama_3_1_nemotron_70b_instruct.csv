These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ekitongole ky'abakyala ekisobola kusabira ku by'obulamu bw'abakyala, ekisinga okukwata ku by'obulamu bw'abakyala, kwalina embeera nnyingi za socio-economic ne za kitamadala ezisobola kuzuula abakyala okusaba ne kusabira ebirungi by'obulamu bw'abakyala.

"For rural communities in Ghana, especially in the Kumbungu district, access to and use of maternal healthcare services (MHCS) remain a significant challenge. This study set out to explore the specific barriers preventing women from utilizing these services and to evaluate the quality of care provided. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to get a comprehensive view of the situation. This phased design involved surveying 441 pregnant and postpartum women and conducting interviews with 20 healthcare providers. A facility checklist was also used to assess the state of clinics, including the availability of essential drugs and equipment.",academic,"[Abantu ab'omu bitundu by'ebulambuzi mu Ghana, ekisinga mu disitulikiti ya Kumbungu, okufuna obujjanjabi bw'abakyala ab'omu maama (MHCS) kisigala kikwata kuwona.

A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Ekisomo kino kikubye nti wakati omuwala wengi aliweza kusaba emirimu gy'abakyala—87.5% yagenda kuwulira mu kaseera k'abakyala abataba (ANC), 87.3% yalabika mu kaseera k'abakyala abataba na wabula w'abakyala abataba, na 84.8% yalabika mu kaseera k'abakyala abataba baada ya kuzaala—ekiseera ky'okulaba kikyali kikulabika kuwa kikwata.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Okusobozesa obulwadde bw'abakyala mu disitulikiti ya Kumbungu, abafunze n'abafumbirwa emikwano gyabwe by'okutendeka.
