"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Khawvela hmasawnna leh nunphung chi hrang hrangte hi MHCS a hman leh a hmang theih lohna kawng hrang hrang a ni.

"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem.

His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept.

He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Naupangte chu, hmeichhe tam takin nu nau dawr dan leh inenkawl dan a kaltlanga an inen a, ANC-ah 87.5% in an kal, 87.3% in an inen a, PNC-ah 84.8% in an kal a, inen kaltlanga an inen dan a zir chiang a, a harsatna a awm.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Kumbungu district-a nuam zawn maternal health thar chhuah nan, zirtirte leh hriatna pe theihtute pawh an lo sawi a, an lo rawtna te pawh an nei a.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life. Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, Okonkwo pa, kum 10 chuang a lo thleng tawh a.
