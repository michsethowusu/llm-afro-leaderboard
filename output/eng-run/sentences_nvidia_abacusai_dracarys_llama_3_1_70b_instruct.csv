"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Ubushakashatsi bwagaragaje ko, igihe cyane cy'abagore bakoraga ubuvuzi bwo kuboneza—87.5% bakoraga ubuvuzi bwo kuboneza kabla y'ukuboneza

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Igikorwa cyo kuzamura ubuzima bw'ababyeyi mu karere ka Kumbungu, abanyeshuri b'ikigani na bafasha ubuzima bemeje ibisubizo bifitanye.
