"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,[Mambo ari pedyo ane mashanduko ari kushanduka ari kuburitswa kwenye tsika dzevanhu na kuburitswa kwenye tsika dzevanhu ari kuburitswa kwenye tsika dzevanhu ari kuburitswa

His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him.

Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration.

Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, baba waOkonkwo, afa makore gumi asati.
