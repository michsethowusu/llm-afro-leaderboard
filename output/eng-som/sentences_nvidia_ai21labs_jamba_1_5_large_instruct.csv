Haweenkii waxay sujaysay in la tixraaco waxbarashada dadweynaha ee caafimaadka haweenka, in la xakameeyo MHCS bilaash, iyo in la karo wadooyinka degmada si ay ugu fududaato adeegyada. Bixiyayaasha adeegyada waxay tilmaameen in la baahan yahay daryeelka dhaqanka oo badan iyo alaabka waxtar leh. Barashada waxay xaqiijisay in hay'adaha dowlada iyo aan dowlada ah ay isla markaana wax ka badalaan caafimaadka haweenka iyo in ay ka dabaal dagaan mas'afaadka bulshada ee ugu dambaysa ku saabsan haweenka. Waa muhiim in la isku raaco siyaasadda caafimaadka iyo xadka bulshada, taas oo ah muhiim u ah in lagu caafimaado haweenka.]","[To get the best health for women in Kumbungu culture, everyone who participated in the study and service providers participated. The women expected that public education in women's health would be referenced, that MHCS would be controlled for free, and that the streets of the district would be cleared to facilitate services. The service providers indicated that more cultural care and useful products were needed.

Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, aabaaha Okonkwo, wuxuu dhintay toddoba sano ka hor. Wuxuu ahaa nin la yaqaan kala duwanaanshiisa iyo kala xumaysnaanshiisa, oo nolol ugu noolaayay maanta, mayna u malaynaya mustaqbalka. Raga kasta oo uu helayâ€”oo ahayn aragti aad u badanâ€”wuxuu guri ugu gudbay palm-wine, isaga iyo jiraydaasi uga qabanaya dabaaldega. Wuxuu aaminsanaa inuu arka afka raga dhintay ay tahay inuu arko jahliilka aan cunayn waxaad hayso nolosha.

He was a man known for his diversity and his wickedness, who lived for the present, not thinking about the future. To anyone who had anything but too many visions, he passed through a house with palm wine, and with it the celebration. He believed that by seeing the mouths of the dead he should see the folly of not eating what life has to offer. Unoka was the one who moved the economy, who moved all the money he had.]"
