"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained. His comments come in the wake of a JoyNews Hotline investigation led by GH Probe’s Francisca Enchil, which uncovered disturbing levels of collusion at examination centres.",news,"[Hawa ni watu ambao hakuna ushahidi kwamba wameonyesha kuwa wanastahili imani ambayo tumeweka nazo. Kuhusu kazi hii, nataka pia kusema kwamba kuhusu BECE, maamuzi mengi yanafanywa na Huduma ya Elimu ya Ghana. Kwa mfano, uteuzi wa wasimamizi na waangalizi hufanywa na afisa wa mtihani wa wilaya, alieleza. Maoni yake yametolewa katika kipindi cha uchunguzi wa JoyNews Hotline ulioongozwa na Francisca Enchil wa GH Probe, ambao uligundua viwango vya kusumbua vya ushirikiano katika vituo vya mtihani.]"
"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Anuwai ya mambo ya kiuchumi na ya kitamaduni yalibainishwa kama vikwazo vikuu vya kupata na kutumia huduma za afya ya akili. Zaidi ya nusu ya wanawake waliohojiwa walitaja umaskini, ujuzi duni wa kusoma na kuandika, vikwazo kutoka kwa waume wao, umbali wa vituo vya afya, na mizunguko ndefu kama sababu za kutotumia huduma. Zaidi ya hayo, zaidi ya theluthi moja ya wanawake walitaja mazoea ya kitamaduni ndani ya jamii zao kama sababu ya kuchelewa kutafuta huduma. Matokeo haya yanaonyesha kwamba kushughulikia afya ya uzazi katika eneo hili kunahitaji zaidi ya kuboresha tu huduma za kimatibabu; pia inamaanisha kushughulikia changamoto za kijamii na za kibinafsi ambazo wanawake hukabiliana nazo kila siku.]"
"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Ingawa alikuwa na mapungufu, Unoka alikuwa mwanamuziki wenye kipaji. Alikuwa mwanamume mrefu lakini mnyembamba sana na miguu iliyopinda na uso wa huzuni, ambao ungepotea anapokunywa pombe au anapovua filimbi yake. Muda wake wa furaha zaidi ulikuwa katika miezi baada ya mavuno, wakati wanamuziki wa kijiji walipokuwa wanachukua ala zao za muziki kutoka juu ya jikoni. Unoka alijiunga nao, uso wake ukijaa furaha na amani. Mara nyingine, vijiji vingine vilimwita Unoka na bendi yake kufundisha nyimbo zao, na walibaki kwa miezi kadhaa, kushiriki muziki wao.]"
"At the Derby Avenue RC Basic School and St. George’s Anglican Basic School in Accra, invigilators were captured openly demanding GH¢60 daily tokens, supervisors pocketed envelopes of GH¢400, and candidates were asked to contribute to an Aseda Offertory. John Kapi stressed that once WAEC provides feedback on such incidents, it is the responsibility of the Ghana Education Service (GES) to take decisive action. And so when these issues come up, once the feedback goes to them, we [WAEC] expect that they would react appropriately and ensure that the right action is taken against the people, he said.",news,"[ Katika Shule ya Msingi ya Derby Avenue RC na Shule ya Msingi ya Anglican ya St. George huko Accra, waangalizi waliwekwa waziwazi wakidai tokeni za kila siku za GH¢60, wasimamizi walipakia sura za GH¢400, na wanafunzi walitakiwa kuchangia Aseda Offertory. John Kapi alisisitiza kwamba mara WAEC inatoa maoni kuhusu matukio hayo, ni wajibu wa Huduma ya Elimu ya Ghana (GES) kuchukua hatua za kufanya maamuzi. Na kwa hivyo wakati masuala haya yanapotokea, mara maoni yanapowasilishwa kwao, tuna [WAEC] matarajio kwamba watajibu ipasavyo na kuhakikisha kwamba hatua sahihi inachukuliwa dhidi ya watu hao, alisema.]"
"For rural communities in Ghana, especially in the Kumbungu district, access to and use of maternal healthcare services (MHCS) remain a significant challenge. This study set out to explore the specific barriers preventing women from utilizing these services and to evaluate the quality of care provided. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to get a comprehensive view of the situation. This phased design involved surveying 441 pregnant and postpartum women and conducting interviews with 20 healthcare providers. A facility checklist was also used to assess the state of clinics, including the availability of essential drugs and equipment.",academic,"[Kwa jamii za vijijini nchini Ghana, hasa katika wilaya ya Kumbungu, upatikanaji na matumizi ya huduma za afya za uzazi (MHCS) bado ni changamoto kubwa.

"Okonkwo was a man of great renown throughout his nine villages and even beyond, a fame built entirely on his own remarkable achievements. At just eighteen years old, he brought honor to his village by defeating Amalinze the Cat, a legendary wrestler who had been undefeated for seven years. Amalinze earned his nickname because his back never once touched the earth. The old men of the village considered Okonkwo's victory one of the fiercest fights they had ever seen.",literature,"[Okonkwo alikuwa mtu maarufu sana katika vijiji vyake tisa na hata zaidi ya hapo, umaarufu uliojengwa kabisa kwenye mafanikio yake ya kipekee.

Amalinze alipata jina lake la utani kwa sababu mgongo wake haukutikisa hata mara moja ardhi. Wazee wa kijiji walichukulia ushindi wa Okonkwo kuwa moja ya mapigano ya fujo zaidi waliyowahi kuona.]"
"Muntaka assured the committee of full logistical and secretariat support from the Ministry and urged them to partner with civil society organizations, development partners, and faith-based institutions in carrying out their work.

Aliielezea kazi hiyo kama nzito lakini ya heshima, akisisitiza kwamba watu wa Gbenyiri na jamii zinazozunguka walikuwa wakimtazama kamati hiyo kama zana za amani, upatanisho, na uponyaji.]"
"The study also shed light on significant facility-based challenges that compromise the quality of care. A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem. For example, health service providers specifically recommended a greater number of trained midwives and the provision of critical logistics like ultrasound machines and proper delivery equipment to ensure effective and high-quality care.",academic,"[Utafiti huo pia ulionyesha changamoto muhimu za kituo ambazo zinadhoofisha ubora wa huduma. Suala muhimu lilikuwa idadi isiyo ya kutosha ya wakunga, ambayo inaweza kuchangia mizunguko ndefu ambayo wanawake waliripoti. Zaidi ya hayo, ukosefu wa vifaa muhimu na dawa ulikuwa tatizo kubwa. Kwa mfano, watoa huduma za afya haswa walipendekeza kuwa na idadi kubwa ya wakunga waliofunzwa na upatikanaji wa vifaa muhimu kama vile mashine za ultrasound na vifaa vya kutosha vya kujifungulia ili kuhakikisha huduma bora na za ubora wa juu.]"
"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo alikuwa mtu mwenye umbo la kuhofia, mrefu na mkubwa na uso mkali, matokeo ya mabega yake makubwa na pua pana. Kupumua kwake kulikuwa kwa uzito sana kwamba familia yake ilikuwa inaweza kusikia kutoka nyumba zao wakati akiwa amelala. Wakati akiwa anatembea, viatu vyake hukaguliwa kidogo tu, na kumfanya kuonekana kama anayeyumbayumba kwa mtu fulani—jambo ambalo mara nyingi alifanya. Alikuwa na kikwazo kidogo cha kusema, na katika nyakati za hasira, alikuwa akitumia mikono yake wakati maneno hayakumtosha. Hakuna subira kwa wanaume ambao hawakuwa wenye mafanikio, na hisia hii ilianza kutoka kwa aibu yake ya ndani kwa ajili ya baba yake mwenyewe.]"
"The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) says officials implicated in acts of corruption during the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) will be blacklisted from ever taking part in its activities again.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Utafiti uligundua kwamba ingawa asilimia kubwa ya wanawake walishiriki katika baadhi ya huduma za afya ya uzazi—87.5% walihudhuria huduma ya kabla ya kujifungua (ANC), 87.3% walipata kujifungua kwa mtaalamu, na 84.8% walipata ziara ya baada ya kujifungua (PNC)—ukawaida wa huduma ulikuwa suala la wasiwasi. Kidogo zaidi ya nusu ya washiriki (53.4%) walikuwa na ziara zinazopendekezwa nne au zaidi za ANC, na karibu nusu (46.9%) hawakujisajili mpaka katika roboduara yao ya pili.

"The crowd held its breath as the drums beat and the flutes sang. Amalinze was a clever opponent, but Okonkwo was just as skilled, and as slippery as a fish in water. Both men were incredibly strong, their muscles and nerves straining to the point of almost breaking. But in the end, Okonkwo emerged victorious. This monumental win was just the beginning of his legacy. Over the next twenty years, his fame spread like a wildfire, fueled by his unwavering resolve and personal triumphs.",literature,"[Umashangao ulikaa kimya wakati ngoma zilipiga na filimbi zilipoimba.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[ Ili kuboresha afya ya uzazi katika wilaya ya Kumbungu, watafiti na watoa huduma walitoa mapendekezo yanayoweza kutekelezwa.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration.
