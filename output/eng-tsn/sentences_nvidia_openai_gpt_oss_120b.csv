"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Setlhogo sa tsa setso le sa tsa ikonomi sa tlhokomelo ya setso le sa ikonomi se ne sa bonwa e le tsela e e kgatlhang ya go feta le go dirisa tsa tlhokomelo ya setso.

"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Le fa a ne a na diphoso, Unoka e ne e le mmusi wa kgotla.

A key issue was the inadequate number of midwives, which likely contributes to the long queues women reported. Additionally, the absence of essential equipment and drugs was a major problem.

His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo e ne e le motho wa kgolo, wa bogolo le wa kgotlhego, a neng a lebelela ka tsela e kgatlhisang, e e tswang ke diboa tsa gagwe tse di tshweu le tse di kgatlhang, tse di neng di mo kgatlhisa.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Ka go fokotsa bophelo jwa basadi mo kgaolong ya Kumbungu, batho ba ba tseneletseng mo kgethong le ba ba emetseng mo go emetseng, ba ne ba kgothaletsa ditshwanelo tse di kgonegang.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future.

He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life.
