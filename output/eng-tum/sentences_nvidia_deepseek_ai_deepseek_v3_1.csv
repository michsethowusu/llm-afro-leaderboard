"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care.

Zaidi ya hayo, zaidi ya theluthi moja ya wanawake walisema desturi za kitamaduni ndani ya jamii zao kuwa sababu ya kuchelewa kutafuta huduma. Matokeo haya yanafichua kwamba kushughulikia afya ya uzazi katika eneo hili kunahitaji zaidi ya kuboresha tu huduma za kimatibabu; pia inamaanisha kushughulikia changamoto za kijamii na za kibinafsi zinazoshikamana sana ambazo wanawake hukabiliana nazo kila siku.]","[A number of social and cultural factors were cited as the main barriers to accessing and using MHCS.
