"These are people who certainly have not proved that they are worthy of the trust that we repose in them. As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Akwanhyia ne amammerɛ nhyehyɛeɛ ahorow a wɔde kyerɛɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nsɛm a ɛde besi nsaman a wɔde kɔ MHCS.

"Despite his shortcomings, Unoka was a talented musician. He was a tall but very thin man with a slight stoop and a mournful look, which would disappear when he was drinking or playing his flute. His happiest moments came in the months after the harvest, when the village musicians would retrieve their instruments from above the fireplace. Unoka would join them, his face filled with pure joy and peace. Sometimes, other villages would invite Unoka and his band to teach them their tunes, and they would stay for several months, sharing their music.",literature,"[Ansa na ɔyɛ abɔdeɛ no, Unoka yɛ nnwontofoɔ a ɔyɛ adwuma yiye.

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Nsɛm no kyerɛɛ sɛ, wɔn a wɔyɛ mmaa no mu dɔɔso kakraa bi a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ nneɛma a ɛfa mmaa a wɔabɔ wɔn wɔn mmɔfra no ho—87.5% kɔɔ antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% wɔn mmɔfra no wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn wɔn w","The study found that women were a minority of those who participated in activities related to women who had not given birth to their children. 87.5% went to antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had no children.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Deɛ ɛbɛboa maame dɔm na Kumbungu mpɔtam no, nneɛma a wɔn a wɔkɔɔ sukuu ne wɔn a wɔde nneɛma ma no nyinaa boa ma wɔn a wɔde nneɛma ma no boa.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life. Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, agya Okonkwo, awuwu mfeɛ du a atwam no.

He has lost the money he earns, which is simple things, he has taken him to the cemetery, and he has lost his travelers to them as symbols. He wants to find out who killed him, who did not work. Unoka is also a man with money to spend on his many travels.]"
