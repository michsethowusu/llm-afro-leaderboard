"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ekulungwane kwezizathu zezopolitiki, zezomnotho, nezokwaziyo kwabonwa njengemithandazo mikulu yokwamkela nokwenza umsebenzi wemithandazo yezempilo yezingane.

"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo waye ngumntu omdala, de wakala kancinci kancinci, enemiso yobuso yobuso, yindlela yokuba yeyona imibala yakhe yezwi ndiyayibonisa, nezwi zake ezikhulu.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[ Ukwenza ukuba impilo yamama ibonakale kancinci kwiSithili saseKumbungu, abaphandi bezifundo kanye nabantu ababamba iqhaza kwenza kubekho iziphumo ezinokwenzeka.

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life. Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, utata kaOkonkwo, usweleke kudala kwa miaka yezintandathu.

He hoped that seeing the door to the house would be a sign of the uncleanness of the food that was in the house. Noka had little money, making money for his many people.]"
