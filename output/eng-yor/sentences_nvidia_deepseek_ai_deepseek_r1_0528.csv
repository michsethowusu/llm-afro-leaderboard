As far as this job is concerned, let me also indicate that when it comes to BECE, most of the decisions are taken by the Ghana Education Service. For example, the selection of supervisors and invigilators is done by the district exams officer, he explained. His comments come in the wake of a JoyNews Hotline investigation led by GH Probe’s Francisca Enchil, which uncovered disturbing levels of collusion at examination centres.",news,"[Èyí ni àwọn ènìyàn tí kò tíì fi èdè wọn hàn pé wọ́n lọ́rọ̀ láti gbà àṣẹ tí a fi sí wọ́n.

"A variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors were identified as major barriers to accessing and utilizing MHCS. Over half of the women surveyed cited poverty, illiteracy, restrictions from their husbands, the distance to health facilities, and long queues as reasons for not using services. Additionally, over a third of the women pointed to cultural practices within their communities as a cause for delays in seeking care. These findings reveal that addressing maternal health in this region requires more than just improving clinical services; it also means tackling deeply rooted societal and personal challenges that women face daily.",academic,"[Ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀ awọn ẹ̀ka ọ̀rọ̀-ẹ̀kọ̀-ẹ̀jọ̀ àti awọn ẹ̀ka ọ̀rọ̀-ẹ̀sìn ni a ti yan lori bi awọn ija pataki fun awọn obinrin lati lo awọn ẹ̀ka ẹ̀kọ̀-ẹ̀jọ̀ MHCS.

"Okonkwo was an imposing figure, tall and massive with a severe expression, a result of his bushy eyebrows and wide nose. His breathing was so heavy that his family could hear it from their own houses when he slept. When he walked, his heels barely touched the ground, making him seem poised to pounce on someone—which he often did. He had a slight stammer, and in moments of anger, he would resort to his fists when words failed him. He had no patience for men who were not successful, and this sentiment stemmed from his deep-seated shame for his own father.",literature,"[Okonkwo jẹ ọkan tobi, giga ati tobi pẹlu ifunmọra ti o duro, nitori eyin rẹ ti o gba ati imọ rẹ ti o gba.

He has a back that stands up, and when he is lying, he will use his thighs when he stands that what he is saying does not stand up. He has no face for a man who is not a face, and this face comes from his standing for his father.]"

"The study found that while a high percentage of women did engage with some maternal health services—87.5% attended antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% had a skilled delivery, and 84.8% had a postnatal care (PNC) visit—the frequency of care was a concern. A little over half of the participants (53.4%) had the recommended four or more ANC visits, and nearly half (46.9%) didn't register until their second trimester. These figures highlight a gap between initial access and consistent, timely utilization of services, suggesting that women may be facing obstacles that prevent them from fully engaging with the healthcare system throughout their pregnancies.",academic,"[Ọmọ-ẹkọ yii fihan pe nigba ti ogorun owo nla ti awọn obinrin ni ipa pẹlu ẹka awọn ẹbi ọmọ—87.5% wọ antenatal care (ANC), 87.3% ni aṣẹ ọmọ ti aṣẹ, ati 84.8% ni aṣẹ postnatal care (PNC) visit—iṣẹju inu ẹka ni aṣẹ.

"To improve maternal health in the Kumbungu district, both study participants and service providers offered actionable recommendations. Women suggested focusing on public education about maternal care, enforcing free MHCS, and improving the local road network to make facilities more accessible. Providers emphasized the need for more midwives and better equipment. The study concludes that both governmental and non-governmental organizations must increase investment in maternal health and address the broader socioeconomic issues affecting women. This comprehensive approach, tackling both healthcare system deficiencies and community-level barriers, is essential for truly improving maternal health outcomes.",academic,"[Laarin lati gba ipo iwoya

"Unoka, Okonkwo's father, had passed away ten years prior. He was a man known for his laziness and carelessness, living only for the present with no thought for the future. Any money he managed to acquire—which was a rare occurrence—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see a dead man's mouth was to see the foolishness of not eating what you had in life. Unoka was also deeply in debt, owing money to nearly every one of his neighbors.",literature,"[Unoka, baba Okonkwo, ti ku ojo ogun odun sẹyin. O jẹ ọkunrin ti a mo fun igbagbọ ati igbagbọ, o si n gbe fun ayẹ, ko si riran fun ayọ. Ọwọ ti o ba gba—ti o jẹ ọna pataki—he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. O gbagbọ pe ki o ri ẹnu ọkunrin ti ku ni ki o ri igbagbọ ti ko gbagbọ fun ẹ ti o ni ni ayẹ.

He was a man known for faith and belief, and lived for celebration, not for pleasure. If the hand that believes it is a special way he would immediately spend on palm-wine, gathering his neighbors for a celebration. He believed that to see the mouth of the dead man is to see the faith of the unbeliever who has the celebration. Unoka's hand is white, and he is confessing it to every man who has it.]"
